# ga-example-diophantine
The example of usage of [Genetic Algorithms and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) and [DEAP](https://github.com/deap/deap) for Kyiv.Py # 16.

 * [Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/mariczhuck/kyivpy16-how-to-easily-find-the-optimal-solution-without-exhaustive-search-using-genetic-algorithms)
 * [Kyiv.py #16 on Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/uapycon/events/225279794/)

The repo aimed to show how a task can be solved with Genetic Algorithms. 

### Example:
**Problem**: find a solution of a linear Diophantine equation.
```python
The equation: 1027 * x + 712 * y = 1
D(x) = [-1 500; 1 500]
D(y) = [-1 500; 1 500]
```
Sure thing, that the problem has the [analytical solution](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiophantineEquation.html).
```python
x = -165
y = 238
```

Just check the code/slides and find how to start with [Genetic Algorithms and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) [DEAP](https://github.com/deap/deap).
